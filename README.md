## Project Goals and Description

Gentrification is the process of neighborhood change resulting from young and/or affluent people moving into areas that have historically been home to marginalized communities. Because of this, community members are often forced to move, which leads to a loss of community, history, and culture. While this phenomenon has been occurring across the United States, it is especially relevant in Seattle because it is the third most quickly gentrifying city in the nation. In fact, Seattle’s Chinatown-International District – a neighborhood home to a vibrant AAPI community – was recognized as one of the eleven most endangered historic places in the country this year. 

In this project, I examine the process of gentrification in Seattle using construction and demolition permit data. Specifically, this project seeks to answer the following questions: **How has Seattle gentrified over the past decade (2011-2023)? What areas of Seattle have been the most affected by gentrification?** The aim of this project is to provide Seattle policymakers, activists, non-profits, and interested community members with information about gentrification occurring city-wide, which will ideally support these stakeholders in taking action on this issue.
